WP File Manager Solid Plugin by WP STAGING.

== Description ==

WP File Manager Solid - This plugin has been developed by the team who created WP STAGING.

<h2>Why Another WP File Manager Plugin?</h2>

There are so many file manager plugins on wordpress.org. How is this one different?

Nearly all WP file manager plugins are build on top of the excellent open source file manager [elfinder](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder "file manager elfinder").

Unfortunately other WordPress file manager plugins do not always update the elfinder version just in time whenever there is an update.
This can lead to serious security issues as a file manager is an essential tool with a lot of power.

We are a team of professionals, and we need a reliable file manager plugin all the time for our clients and users.
As we have to make sure that the code of the file manager is clean, robust, well-tested and secure we decided to release our own implementation of a file manager plugin for WordPress.

As it is more fun to share the work with other people we decided to release the file manager publically.

<h2>File Manager Solid - Features:</h2>

- Usefull default settings to make sure the file manager is secure as possible.
- Access only for administrators! No public settings to give non-admin users access to the wp file manager, even not by accident.
- We make sure that the built-in elfinder file manager is always the latest version
- We work closely with the developers of elfinder
- You'll get a warning when there is a new version of elfinder and WP File Manager Solid does not use the latest version
- We follow [SOLID Principles in PHP](https://dev.to/evrtrabajo/solid-in-php-d8e). Guess why we've chosen Solid as plugin name;-)
